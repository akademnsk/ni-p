	abstract = "Fe3P is a candidate component in planetary cores. We have investigated high-pressure behavior of Fe3P by first-principles calculations and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. Theoretical calculations reveal a magnetic collapse at 40--65 GPa, accompanied by a structural transition. The possible high-pressure polymorph is either a distorted cementite structure (Pnma) or a P4/mnc structure. By combining synchrotron X-ray diffraction and laser-heating diamond anvil cell techniques, we have collected in situ diffraction patterns of Fe3P up to 64 GPa and 1650 K. The high-pressure phase transition from I4Â¯ to P4/mnc structure predicted by the first-principles calculations was confirmed. Discontinuous variations of lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients with pressure were observed around 17 and 40 GPa, indicating a possible magnetic transition developed in this range, which are in agreement with the calculated results.",

	abstract = "{Allabogdanite, (Fe,Ni)(2)P, is the only known natural high-pressure phase reported in the Fe-Ni-P system. The mineral, which was previously described from a single meteorite, the Onello iron, is now discovered in the Santa Catharina and Barbianello nickel-rich ataxites. The occurrence of allabogdanite in Santa Catharina, one of the largest and well-studied meteorites, suggests that this mineral is more common than was believed. The formation of allabogdanite-bearing phosphide assemblages in a given meteorite provides evidence that it experienced peak pressure of at least 8 GPa at a temperature above 800 degrees C. Since the pressure-temperature stability parameters of allabogdanite fall within the margins of the stishovite (rutile-type SiO2) stability area, the former can be employed as a convenient stishovite-grade indicator of significant impact events experienced by iron and stony-iron meteorites and their parent bodies.}",

	abstract = "Evolutionary crystal structure prediction proved to be a powerful approach in discovering new materials. Certain limitations are encountered for systems with a large number of degrees of freedom (``large systems'') and complex energy landscapes (``complex systems''). We explore the nature of these limitations and address them with a number of newly developed tools. For large systems a major problem is the lack of diversity: any randomly produced population consists predominantly of high-energy disordered structures, offering virtually no routes toward the ordered ground state. We offer two solutions: first, modified variation operators that favor atoms with higher local order (a function we introduce here), and, second, construction of the first generation non-randomly, using pseudo-subcells with, in general, fractional atomic occupancies. This enhances order and diversity and improves energies of the structures. We introduce an additional variation operator, coordinate mutation, which applies preferentially to low-order (``badly placed'') atoms. Biasing other variation operators by local order is also found to produce improved results. One promising version of coordinate mutation, explored here, displaces atoms along the eigenvector of the lowest-frequency vibrational mode. For complex energy landscapes, the key problem is the possible existence of several energy funnels -- in this situation it is possible to get trapped in one funnel (not necessarily containing the ground state). To address this problem, we develop an algorithm incorporating the ideas of abstract ``distance'' between structures. These new ingredients improve the performance of the evolutionary algorithm USPEX, in terms of efficiency and reliability, for large and complex systems.",

	abstract = "The observed variation of the seismic velocities with depth, below the crust, is examined with reference to the variation to be expected in a homogeneous medium. A general equation is derived for the variation of the quantity, , in a homogeneous gravitating layer with an arbitrary gradient of temperature. The parameters of this equation are then discussed in terms of the experimental and theoretical relations for solids. The principal parameter is (âKT/âP)T, the rate of change of isothermal incompressibility with pressure, which can be found for large compressions from Bridgman's measurements. Comparison of observed and expected rates of variation of Ï throughout the Earth's interior leads to conclusions regarding homogeneity and, with a larger uncertainty, to estimates of temperature. A shadow zone at a depth of about 100 km, as suggested by Gutenberg, may be accounted for by a gradient of temperature of about 6Â°/km in a homogeneous layer of ultrabasic rock. Between depths of about 900 and 2,900 km, the mantle appears to be substantially uniform, and at a relatively uniform temperature of the order of several thousand degrees. Between about 200 and 900 km, the rate of rise of velocity is too great for a homogeneous layer, and indicates a gradual change of composition, or of phase, or both. New phases are required to account for the high elasticity of the deeper part of the mantle (below 900 km), and it is suggested that, beginning at about 200 to 300 km, there is a gradual shift toward high-pressure modifications of the ferro-magnesian silicates, probably close-packed oxides, with the transition complete at about 800 to 900 km. There may also be a concentration of alumina, lime, and alkalis toward the upper part of the mantle, in and above the transitional layer but below the crust, existing in minerals of high elasticity such as garnets and jadeites. The transitional layer appears to hold the key to a number of major geophysical problems. The velocities in the core and inner core are also reviewed. The inner core is most simply interpreted as crystalline iron, the outer part as liquid iron, perhaps alloyed with a small fraction of lighter elements. The density and compressibility of iron at high pressures are estimated with the aid of the experimental compressions of the alkali metals; the central density is found to be about 15. Several other recent proposals regarding the crust are discussed.",

	abstract = "The bulk composition of the Earth and the composition of the mantle and core are calculated using the ratios of major and trace elements. The ratios of elements which do not enter the core (lithophile) are the same in the bulk Earth as in the mantle. Bulk earth ratios involving an element that does enter the core (siderophile) are therefore determined from meteorite correlation diagrams of siderophile-lithophile ratios vs. lithophile-lithophile ratios and from primitive mantle composition in elements which do not enter the core (e.g., Al). The composition of the core is determined by difference, without resorting to assumptions about core formation processes. It is found that the core contains about 7.3 wt\% silicon and 2.3 wt\% sulphur. To account for the seismologically determined density deficit of the core, about 4 wt\% oxygen must be added. The present results are compatible with the idea that the core material equilibrated at low pressure, in reducing conditions. Furthermore, we propose that the Earth is closer to CM rather than to C1 for non-volatile element ratios.",

	abstract = "Compositional models of the Earth are critically dependent on three main sources of information: the seismic profile of the Earth and its interpretation, comparisons between primitive meteorites and the solar nebula composition, and chemical and petrological models of peridotite-basalt melting relationships. Whereas a family of compositional models for the Earth are permissible based on these methods, the model that is most consistent with the seismological and geodynamic structure of the Earth comprises an upper and lower mantle of similar composition, an Feî¸Ni core having between 5\% and 15\% of a low-atomic-weight element, and a mantle which, when compared to CI carbonaceous chondrites, is depleted in Mg and Si relative to the refractory lithophile elements. The absolute and relative abundances of the refractory elements in carbonaceous, ordinary, and enstatite chondritic meteorites are compared. The bulk composition of an average CI carbonaceous chondrite is defined from previous compilations and from the refractory element compositions of different groups of chondrites. The absolute uncertainties in their refractory element compositions are evaluated by comparing ratios of these elements. These data are then used to evaluate existing models of the composition of the Silicate Earth. The systematic behavior of major and trace elements during differentiation of the mantle is used to constrain the Silicate Earth composition. Seemingly fertile peridotites have experienced a previous melting event that must be accounted for when developing these models. The approach taken here avoids unnecessary assumptions inherent in several existing models, and results in an internally consistent Silicate Earth composition having chondritic proportions of the refractory lithophile elements at â¼ 2.75 times that in CI carbonaceous chondrites. Element ratios in peridotites, komatiites, basalts and various crustal rocks are used to assess the abundances of both non-lithophile and non-refractory elements in the Silicate Earth. These data provide insights into the accretion processes of the Earth, the chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle, the effect of core formation, and indicate negligible exchange between the core and mantle throughout the geologic record (the last 3.5 Ga). The composition of the Earth's core is poorly constrained beyond its major constituents (i.e. an Feî¸Ni alloy). Density contrasts between the inner and outer core boundary are used to suggest the presence (â¼ 10 Â± 5\%) of a light element or a combination of elements (e.g., O, S, Si) in the outer core. The core is the dominant repository of siderophile elements in the Earth. The limits of our understanding of the core's composition (including the light-element component) depend on models of core formation and the class of chondritic meteorites we have chosen when constructing models of the bulk Earth's composition. The Earth has a bulk FeAl of â¼ 20 Â± 2, established by assuming that the Earth's budget of Al is stored entirely within the Silicate Earth and Fe is partitioned between the Silicate Earth (â¼ 14\%) and the core (â¼ 86\%). Chondritic meteorites display a range of FeAl ratios, with many having a value close to 20. A comparison of the bulk composition of the Earth and chondritic meteorites reveals both similarities and differences, with the Earth being more strongly depleted in the more volatile elements. There is no group of meteorites that has a bulk composition matching that of the Earth's.",

Hexagonal close-packed structure (hcp) is the accepted stable form of pure Fe; however, it has been recently proposed that a body-centered-cubic (bcc) structured alloy of Fe with lighter elements would be a strong candidate. Experiments and ab initio calculations have shown that small amounts of silicon can stabilize the bcc phase with respect to the hcp phase. In this study we examine the effect at core conditions by adding small concentrations of carbon (C), sulphur (S) and oxygen (O) to iron using electronic structure calculations. We analyze the effect of the light elements on the energy difference between the two structures, and we conclude that the bcc phase tends to be stabilized by the alloys, strengthening the case for a bcc-structured inner core of the Earth.",

As a non-metal, its solubility in iron is limited, leading to the precipitation of phosphides at high concentrations. Here we present experimental results for the iron-rich portions of the Fe-P and Fe-P-S systems at 23 GPa. We find a Fe-P eutectic point occurring at 9 wt\% P and 1275Â°C at 23 GPa. Up to 4 wt\% P is soluble in the Fe-rich solid coexisting with the eutectic liquid at these conditions. The ternary Fe-P-S system displays a simple cotectic between the Fe-P and Fe-S binary eutectics with minimum melting temperature on the S-side at 1075Â°C. At subsolidus conditions there is complete solid solution between Fe3P and Fe3S. The high solubility of phosphorus in iron along with its miscibility in Fe3S and iron-sulfur liquids at high pressures, combined with expectation of only minor concentrations in planetary cores, indicate phosphorus will not form a distinct phase within terrestrial planet cores.",

	abstract = "Geochemical estimates indicate that around 90\% of the planet's inventory of phosphorus is likely to be sequestered in the Earth's core. Iron phosphides such as scheirbisites (Fe3P) are commonly found in iron meteorites. Recently, melliniite (Fe,Ni)4P with 12.2 wt\% phosphorus has been reported in iron-meteorites. Using static electronic structure calculations, we predict that Fe4P is unlikely to dissociate into Fe3P and hcp Fe at inner core conditions. Among the different structural varieties of Fe4P, we find the cubic polymorph with P213 space group symmetry to be stable over a wide range of geophysically relevant pressures. We have determined the equation of state and the full elastic constant tensor of the stable (Fe,Ni)4P phase at pressures up to 400 GPa. Upon compression, Fe4P undergoes a ferromagnetic (fm) to nonmagnetic (nm) transition at 80 GPa. In nonmagnetic (Fe,Ni)4P, nickel incorporation results in reduction of the P- and S-wave velocities. However, incorporation of nickel enhances the P- and S-wave anisotropy.",

Some samples of Fe3P were also laser heated at high pressure to temperatures of â¼2000 K and examined following thermal quench. Below 8 GPa, variation of the schreibersite unit cell delineates a smooth pressure-volume curve corresponding to a second order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state with bulk modulus, K0T, of 159(1) GPa. Above 8 GPa, however, the schreibersite structure shows substantial stiffening, and an unidentified structure develops between 17 and 30 GPa; upon decompression to ambient pressure the schreibersite structure returns. Therefore, although ubiquitous in iron-rich meteorites, it is unlikely that schreibersite is the stable phosphorus-bearing phase in deep planetary cores.",

	abstract = "Minerals with composition (Fe,Ni)2P, are rare, though important accessory phases in iron and chondritic meteorites. The occurrence of these minerals in meteorites is believed to originate either from the equilibrium condensation of protoplanetary materials in solar nebulae or from the later accretion and condensation processes in the cores of parent bodies. Fe-Ni phosphides are considered a possible candidate for a minor phase present in the Earth's core, and at least partially responsible for the observed density deficit with respect to pure iron. We report results of high-pressure high-temperature X-ray diffraction experiments with synthetic barringerite (Fe2P) up to 40 GPa and 1400 K. A new phase transition to the Co2Si-type structure has been found at 8.0 GPa, upon heating. The high-pressure phase can be metastably quenched to ambient conditions at room temperature, and then, if heated again, transforms back to barringerite, providing an important constraint on the thermodynamic history of meteorite.",

The possible high-pressure polymorph is either a distorted cementite structure (Pnma) or a P4/mnc structure. By combining synchrotron X-ray diffraction and laser-heating diamond anvil cell techniques, we have collected in situ diffraction patterns of Fe3P up to 64 GPa and 1650 K. The high-pressure phase transition from I4Â¯ to P4/mnc structure predicted by the first-principles calculations was confirmed. Discontinuous variations of lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients with pressure were observed around 17 and 40 GPa, indicating a possible magnetic transition developed in this range, which are in agreement with the calculated results.",

At room conditions, Ni2P has hexagonal C22-type structure, and without heating it remains in this structure to at least 50 GPa. With a bulk modulus K0 = 201(8) GPa and K' = 4.2(6), Ni2P is noticeably less compressible than hcp Fe, as well as all previously described iron phosphides, and its presence in the Earth core would favorably lower the core density.

The transformation involves development of triatomic phosphorous clusters and interconnected Ni slabs with diamondoid topology. The high-pressure phase, which represents intermediate polymerization step, is a commensurately modulated superstructure of the NiAs aristotype.

	abstract = "The nickel arsenide (B81) and related crystal structures are among the most important crystallographic arrangements assumed by Fe and Ni compounds with light elements such as Si, O, S, and P, expected to be present in planetary cores. Despite the simple structure, some of these materials like troilite (FeS) exhibit complex phase diagrams and rich polymorphism, involving significant changes in interatomic bonding and physical properties. NiP (oP16) represents one of the two principal structure distortions found in the nickel arsenide family and is characterized by P--P bonding interactions that lead to the formation of P2 dimers. In the current study, the single-crystal synchrotron X-ray diffraction technique, aided by first principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, has been applied to examine the compression behavior of NiP up to 30 GPa. Two new reversible displacive phase transitions leading to orthorhombic high-pressure phases with Pearson symbols oP40 and oC24 were found to occur at approximately 8.5 and 25.0 GPa, respectively. The oP40 phase has the primitive Pnma space group with unit cell a = 4.7729(5) {\AA}, b = 16.6619(12) {\AA}, and c = 5.8071(8) {\AA} at 16.3(1) GPa and is a superstructure of the ambient oP16 phase with multiplicity of 2.5. The oC24 phase has the acentric Cmc21 space group with unit cell a = 9.695(6) {\AA}, b = 5.7101(9) {\AA}, and c = 4.7438(6) {\AA} at 28.5(1) GPa and is a superstructure of the oP16 phase with multiplicity of 1.5. DFT calculations fully support the observed sequence of phase transitions. The two new phases constitute logical next stages of P sublattice polymerization, in which the dilution of the P3 units, introduced in the first high-pressure phase, decreases, leading to compositions of Ni20(P3)4(P2)4 and Ni12(P3)4, and provide important clues to understanding of phase relations and transformation pathways in the NiAs family.",

The occurrence of allabogdanite in Santa Catharina, one of the largest and well-studied meteorites, suggests that this mineral is more common than was believed. The formation of allabogdanite-bearing phosphide assemblages in a given meteorite provides evidence that it experienced peak pressure of at least 8 GPa at a temperature above 800 Â°C. Since the pressure-temperature stability parameters of allabogdanite fall within the margins of the stishovite (rutile-type SiO2) stability area, the former can be employed as a convenient stishovite-grade indicator of significant impact events experienced by iron and stony-iron meteorites and their parent bodies.",

However, despite extensive studies over many years, no single alloying light-element has been found that is able to simultaneously match the observed inner-core density and both seismic velocities. This has motivated a number of suggestions of other mechanism to lower velocities, such as anelasticity or premelting. However, an unexplored possibility is that a combination of two or more light-elements might produce the desired reduction in velocities and densities of the inner core. In order to test this, we use ab initio molecular dynamics calculations to map the elastic property space of hcp-Fe alloyed with S, Si and C at 360 GPa up to the melting temperature. Based on a mixing solid solution model together with direct simulations on the ternaries, we found a number of compositions which are able to match the observed properties of the inner core. This is the first time that the density, VP, Vs and the Poisson's ratio of the inner core have been matched directly with an hcp-Fe alloy.",

	abstract = "{\it VESTA} is a three-dimensional visualization system for crystallographic studies and electronic state calculations. It has been upgraded to the latest version, {\it VESTA3}, implementing new features including drawing the external mor{\-}phology of crystals; superimposing multiple structural models, volumetric data and crystal faces; calculation of electron and nuclear densities from structure parameters; calculation of Patterson functions from structure parameters or volumetric data; integration of electron and nuclear densities by Voronoi tessellation; visualization of isosurfaces with multiple levels; determination of the best plane for selected atoms; an extended bond-search algorithm to enable more sophisticated searches in complex molecules and cage-like structures; undo and redo in graphical user interface operations; and significant performance improvements in rendering isosurfaces and calculating slices.",
